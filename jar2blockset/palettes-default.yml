# Palettes, essentially, use the same filter computation mechanic -- except, these are
# whitelist filters, meaning blocks NOT in "includes", will NOT be in the palette;
# the "excludes" category is only used for include overrides, i.e. when you want to
# include every "red_$" block from the blockset EXCEPT for "red_sandstone$".
# If a computed pallete happens to contain zero blocks, it won't be added to the list.
