# vueblocks

Just like original HB, this is a frontend-only SPA, this time written in Vue 3 and with bigger modularity in mind.


## How to run

1. Generate your blocksets if you haven't already — see README in jar2blockset for more info!

2. Install required npm packages — `npm i` (this will take a few minutes)

3. Run `npm run build`

4. Put your folder with blocksets right inside this directory, and make sure its name is "data". Likewise, if you want to use `npm run dev` for live development server, put the folder right inside this directory.

5. Finally, deploy or launch using `npm run preview`. Voila!
